It is currently using Scikit Fuzzy's Python Module to implement a relatively straightforward fuzzy logic controller.  This controller should be considered pre-Alpha and extremely experimental.  This module will store the fuzzy logic controller in an object, which is saved/pickled in the controller directory, named 'fuzzy.pickle'.  If any changes are made to the default fuzzy logic controller settings, then this pickle file should be deleted so that a new object can be created with new settings.  Note that it may take a very long time for the object to be generated on the Raspberry Pi due to the limited performance capabilities of that processor.",
