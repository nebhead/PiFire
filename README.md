## Raspberry Pi based Smoker Grill Controller

***Note:*** *This project is continuously evolving, and thus this readme will likely be improved over time, as I find the inspiration to make adjustments.  That being said, I'm sure there will be many errors that I have overlooked or sections that I haven't updated. This project is something I've done for both fun and for self-education.  If you decide to implement this project for yourself, and run into issues/challenges, feel free to submit an issue here on GitHub.  However, I would highly encourage you to dig in and debug the issue as much as you can on your own for the sake of growing your own knowledge.  Also, I have a very demanding day job, a family, and lots of barbecue to make - so please have patience with me.*

***Warning:*** *The creator of this project takes no responsibility for any damage that you may do to your personal property including modifications to your smoker grill if you choose to use this project.  The creator also takes no responsibility for any resulting harm or damages that may come from issues with the hardware or software design.*  ***This project is provided for educational purposes, and should be attempted only by individuals who wish to assume all risks involved.***

### Introduction
This project was inspired by user dborello and his excellent PiSmoker project (http://engineeredmusings.com/pismoker/ and https://github.com/DBorello/PiSmoker).  I encourage you to check it out and get a rough idea of how this all works.  This particular project was built around a Traeger Texas smoker grill platform, but should work for most older Traeger models (or other brands with similar parts like the older Pit Boss) built with similar parts (fan, auger, and igniter).  I've built the code in a way to be somewhat modular & extensible such that you can replace the grill platform with your own specific platform instead.  Newer Traeger grills with their newer wifi enabled controllers have DC components (instead of the AC Fan / Auger) and aren't covered by this project.  

Just as with the PiSmoker project, I had a few goals in mind.  I also wanted to have tighter temperature controls, wireless control, and plotting of the grill / meat temperatures.  In addition, I wanted to design this project such that original smoker controller could be used if needed.  This way, if I wanted to, I could use my controller as a monitoring device for temperatures instead of controlling the temperature and leave that up to the original controller.  Basically, it was my fallback plan in case my project didn't work out, or if I wanted to do a quick cook on the Traeger without using the fancy GUI.  **UPDATE (11/2021)** After spending lots of time with PiFire, I've finally removed the original controller in favor of using PiFire exclusively.  However, this doesn't mean that you can't still retain your original controller if you want.  Both modes work fine.

### Screenshots & Videos

The dashboard is where most of your key information and controls are at.  This is the screen that greets you when you access the PiFire WebUI on your computer, smart phone or tablet in a browser.

![Dashboard](docs/webui/PiFire-Dashboard-01.png)

For those of us who like to see the data, PiFire allows you to graph and save your cook history.  It's also a great way to monitor your cook in realtime.  

![History](docs/webui/PiFire-History-00.png)

PiFire also provides an optional Pellet Manager which can help you track your pellet usage, store ratings, check your pellet level if you have a pellet sensor equipped.  

![Pellet Manager](docs/webui/PiFire-PelletManager-00.png)

This is what PiFire looks like on your mobile device.  And in these screen shots you'll notice that we have dark mode enabled.  This helps for viewing at night, or just if you like the dark theme better.  Personally I think it looks pretty slick.

Below is an example comparison that I did on a real cook of the Traeger controller attempting to hold 275F and the PiFire holding at the same temperature.  The difference is very impressive.  The Traeger swings massively up to 25F over and under the set temperature.  However the PID in from PiSmoker does a great job holding roughly +-7 degrees.  And this is without any extra tuning.

Here's a brief YouTube video giving a basic overview of the PiFire web interfaces.

### PiFire Overview Video

I recommend at least taking a peek at the PiFire overview video below.  It covers the basics of operation, settings and control.

### Updates

* 9/2020 - Initial Release
* 12/2020 - Moved documentation to [https://nebhead.github.io/PiFire-Pages](https://nebhead.github.io/PiFire-Pages)
* 11/2021 - Many new features, bug fixes, and improvements.  New hardware support etc. which have been in incorporated over the last year, have been merged from the development branch
* 4/2022 - Release v1.3.1 - Another HUGE release with many new features including an updater, a new configuration wizard, bug fixes, Smart Start feature and much, much more!
* 6/2022 - Release v1.3.3 - Lot's of changes for this latest stable release for June 2022. It's been a busy couple of months and we've had a few bug fixes pulled into this latest version, including an installer bug. The display modules have been completely overhauled in this latest release to improve responsiveness and capabilities. We've added a module for the ILI1394 with rotary encoder support, which is a nice option for those who like to use a dial with push button to interface the menu system. When doing the update, consider doing a full reboot (instead of just restarting the server) to ensure connected display devices are fully reset.
* 7/2022 - Release v1.3.4 - Another monthly release with some bug fixes and some new features. The biggest new feature of this month was the addition of Annotations in the history graph. This gives you helpful tags on the graph (see below) with indicators of the mode changes. Of course you can turn this off in the history page if you don't like it.
* 10/2022 - Release v1.3.5 - Bug fixes, feature refinements and brand new features galore in this latest release.  Added a new ADS1115 module (using Adafruits Circuit Python), due to some reports of issues with the existing ADS1115 module. These can be optionally selected in the configuration wizard.  PWM Fan Support and a boatload of code cleanup was introduced, thanks to contributor @weberbox.  Support for saving cook files was introduced in this version, so that you can go back to older cooks, edit some of the information and add images and comments.  Added a Prime Mode to allow you to prime the fire pot with pellets prior to a cook, and even prime & startup.  Added estimated pellet usage to the pellet manager, which will attempt to track just how many pellets you have used since your last load of pellets.  Added Apprise notification capability thanks to contributor @calonmerc.  320x200 displays have been update and added timers to specific modes. And even more!  
* 6/2023 - Release v1.5.0 - Arguably one of the biggest overhauls to PiFire since it's inception.  The Probe system has been completely refactored to allow for multiple probe sensing devices (i.e. ADS1115, MAX31865, or even Virtual Probes to augment your inputs).  This extension of the probe system, allows for any number of probe inputs to be tracked in PiFire, allowing from notifications and tracking of history for each probe.  The sky is the limit!  With this change the the probe architecture, a number of other things needed to be modified/updated, including the notification system, the history/charting, the dashboards, cookfiles and recipe modes.  Note that if you are updating to this version, your settings will be upgraded in the process and you will not be able to roll back to a previous version (unless you restore from a backup of your settings).  
* 11/2023 - Release v1.6.0 - In this month comes another huge update with lots of new features and bug fixes.  Many thanks to the users from discord that have been testing along the way (as well as submitting some bugs), what a great community we have!  Many of these features have been deployed on our development branch for some time, so they should be relatively stable.  Please do file issues on GitHub if you find any new bugs with the formal release.  With that, enjoy and happy grilling/smoking!
* 5/2024 - Release v1.7.0 - Lot's of new updates in this release with the UI, new features (i.e. exit startup temp, etc.) and new device support.  Some improvements to the tuning tools (including an auto-tuning tool).  Under the covers improvements for stability and cleanup.  As usual, submit issues to GitHub if you run into anything.  Enjoy!
* 9/2024 - Release v1.8.0 - Overhaul of the configuration wizard and underlying platform pin definitions to support board selection and configuration versus the platform selection that was previously provided.  This allows much more flexibility when it comes to custom pinouts.  This version now supports the PCB v4.x modular design allowing the ability to mix and match probe devices, relay/fan hardware, etc.
* **4/2025 - Release v1.9.0** - Almost too many new features and bug fixes to include in a short blurb here.  This release brings an overhaul to Manual Mode, moving the manual controls to the control panel with a PWM slider.  Added the ability to override outputs(igniter, auger, fan) on the default dashboard (and on the flex display).  Added new notifications for high and low temperature limits for each probe.  Added Bluetooth probe support for Inkbird iBBQ and some Meater devices.  Added three new PID controllers which further improve performance of the default PID.  New display support for different devices.  Some probe configuration can be done from the settings page and from the Default Dashboard.  Lid/Door Pause button added to Default Dashboard to manually pause the PID.  And much more!
