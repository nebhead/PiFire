               This release contains bug fixes and feature updates since the previous version. 
            </p>

            <p>
               <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <b>Quality of Life:</b> Added Python Module List to the admin page (Admin > Module List).  This will show you the modules that are installed and their version numbers.  This is useful to debug common package version issues. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>Behind the scenes improvements including:</b>  
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Changed install script to utilize UV for creating a VENV and installing dependencies.  This results in a much faster installation process, quicker upgrades and street cred.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Changed the behavior of the control script so that controller configuration can be modified while in Hold mode.  This allows you to you to manually tune your PID, potentially, while running a test burn.  In the future, this may be extended to allow auto-tuning capabilities.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Moved to Flask 3.1.0 which will allow PiFire to take advantage of the new security and performance updates. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Fresh installations will now pin all versions of the python package dependencies to improve reliability and stability. 
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-bug-slash"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are some bug fixes in this update:</u></p>
            
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Fixed bug with fresh installations where Redis python 6.0.0 deprecated charset encoding parameter.  Pinned to Redis Python 5.3.0 for now.
               </li>
