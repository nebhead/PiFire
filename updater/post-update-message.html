            <ul>
               <li>
                  <b>Default Dashboard:</b> Default dashboard now shows dashes on the gauges when stopped to help avoid confusion that any temperatures are being actively displayed when stopped.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>Flex Display Improvements:</b> Updates the Flex display to show dashes on the gauges when stopped.  Hopefully this will help avoid confusion that any temperatures are being actively displayed when stopped.

                  <b>ETA Calculation Disable:</b> You can now disable estimated time to target calculations for probes on the dashboard via a new setting in the Global Dashboard Settings.  This is useful for users who do not want ETA calculations to be performed.

               <li>
                  <b>Settings Page Improvements:</b> Organized into sections that make more sense (Frontend Settings, Operations, Probe Settings). Work Mode Settings is now Controller Settings to better reflect its purpose.
