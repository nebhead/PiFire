               <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <b>Quality of Life:</b> Added Python Module List to the admin page (Admin > Module List).  This will show you the modules that are installed and their version numbers.  This is useful to debug common package version issues. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>Installer Improvements:</b> For fresh installations, Raspberry Pi OS 12 (Bookworm) (32/64-Bit) is recommended.  This is the latest stable release of Raspberry Pi OS and is highly recommended for new installations.  If you are running an older version of Raspberry Pi OS, you can still upgrade.  For Bookworm 64-Bit, this new installer will install UV and will log the installation process to a file in your home directory.  Note: If you are using the DSI connected display, you will need to use only 32-Bit Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye or Bookworm) due to the changes in display drivers in the 64-Bit version. 
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>Behind the scenes improvements including:</b>  
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Changed install script to utilize UV for creating a VENV and installing dependencies.  This results in a much faster installation process, quicker upgrades and street cred.  Only applicable to Raspberry Pi OS 12 (Bookworm) 64-Bit and later.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Changed the behavior of the control script so that controller configuration can be modified while in Hold mode.  This allows you to you to manually tune your PID, potentially, while running a test burn.  In the future, this may be extended to allow auto-tuning capabilities.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Moved to Flask 3.1.0 which will allow PiFire to take advantage of the new security and performance updates. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Fresh installations will now pin all versions of the python package dependencies to improve reliability and stability. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Updated the board-config utility to gather os information in os_info.json. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Moved all Flask Web UI Routes to the Flask Blueprint system.  This will allow for easier management of the web UI in the future and it considerably cleans up the app.py file. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        @weberbox updated the SocketIO code to support the latest version of the Android app. 
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-bug-slash"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are some bug fixes in this update:</u></p>
            
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Fixed bug with fresh installations where Redis python 6.0.0 deprecated charset encoding parameter.  Pinned to Redis Python 5.3.0 for now.
               </li>
