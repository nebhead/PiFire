               Please note that if you were previously using the BT Meater modules (standard or alternative), they have been renamed.  The updater
               should automatically rename the configuration, but if you experience any errors, please go through the configuration again. <br>

                This release contains bug fixes and feature updates since the previous version.

                 <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
             </p>
             
             <ul>
                 <li>
                    Minor overhaul of manual mode, moving the controls to the control panel so that you can control the grill outputs directly
                    from the dashboard if you desire.  Buttons and PWM slider is responsive without reloading the page.  Improved manual mode instructions.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added the ability to manually override outputs (igniter, auger, fan) on the default dashboard and on the flex touch display.  The user 
                    can enable this in the safety settings, and select the amount of seconds to override the controller during operation.  Use with caution 
                    as this can potentially leave the igniter on for extended periods of time.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added high and low limit temperature notifications for each probe.  This allows you to to set limits for the high and low temperatures
                    and be notified when they exceed those limits during operation.  These limits do not expire, but will only trigger once they are exceeded.
                    They will reset when the temperature falls below/above the high/low limit.  This feature also allows you to take some actions such as to 
                    reignite the grill if the temperature goes too low or to shutdown if it goes too high.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added iBBQ Bluetooth probe support.  Tested with Inkbird BT-4XS.  The device may take some time to be detected and setup before data is 
                    is streamed out to the dashboard.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    User @dogtreatfairy contributed two new controllers including an auto-center PID controller and a PID controller with Smith Predictor. 
                    Github user @markalston contributed a new clamping PID controller.  
                    Select these controllers in the settings page.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added ST7789V with Encoder support.  This should still be considered experimental, as it uses an unsupported forked ST7789 library for display 
                    support. Note that if you select this display version, it will install this forked library and will cause the original ST7789 library not to 
                    function anymore.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added option to delete all debug log files.  This can help with debugging issues, so that we have a clean log file to work with.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added support for Meater Bluetooth probes (Meater Pro is still under development).  This is a work in progress and may not be fully functional.  
                    The probe must be configured in the Wizard before it can be used.  The probe will automatically connect to the PiFire device when the device is 
                    powered on.  The probe will also automatically disconnect when the PiFire device is powered off.  The probe will also automatically reconnect if 
                    the PiFire device is rebooted.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added device status structure that can be retrieved from the /api/current route.  This includes the current state of the device, the current 
                    configuration, and the current status of the probes.  This allows the dashboard to display connection status and/or battery status for bluetooth 
                    probes.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added support for the ILI3941 display with the flex framework.  This utilizes the same framework as is being used for the DSI Touch display, and 
                    will allow for the ILI9341 display to be customized, as well as allow for the use of different resolutions.  (note 480x320 is not currently implemented)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added bluetooth scanning in the configuration wizard so that you can select the hardware ID of a bluetooth device that you want to use.  It will
                    flag hardware ids that are already in use, but it won't prevent you from setting them. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Update the probe configuration wizard to hide/show profile selection based on the probe device.  Only ADC devices should show profile selections. 
                    Also hides/shows the probe enabled selection based on the probe type (AUX is by default hidden).
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Updated the probe configuration in the settings page.  The default dashboard also has probe configuration built in, using the cog in each of the probe cards.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Removed hopper level from the different display types when no hopper level / distance sensor is enabled.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added a button & menu option to the flex supported displays (DSI Touch / ILI9341f / Prototype Flex).
                    Added a button/status icon in the status card for the default dashboard.  You can click on this icon during hold mode to toggle lid/door open.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Added touch screen mode to the default dashboard configuration, which provides some visual and UI changes that will make using a touch screen 
                    device easier.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Github user @markalston contributed the ST7789 240x240 display layout and support in a new module.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Github user @wightmanjr contributed the ILI9488 320x480 display modules including encoder and button support.   
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Behind the scenes improvements including:  
                     <ul>
                         <li>
                             Changed order of component installations when installing modules from the wizard.  The wizard will now install apt packages before 
                             installing python modules to match dependencies for items like bluepy.    
                         </li>
                         <li>
                           Added Lid/Door toggle API call which allows you to manually toggle on/off the lid/door open pause for the controller in Hold mode.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                           Added a nicer Nginx server error landing page that will attempt to load the root ('/') every 10 seconds, provides a link to the Supervisor,
                           and other helpful links.  This currently will only be available on new installations.
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
             </ul>
             
             <p><i class="fa-solid fa-bug-slash"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are some bug fixes in this update:</u></p>
             
             <ul>
                 <li>
                    Removed certain unsupported rotations from the ST7789 320x240 display configurations.  (90/270 degrees are not supported by the ST7789 driver module)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Fixed a missing voltage bounds check for ADC probes using Celsius units.  This should prevent the probes from reporting invalid temperatures when probes 
                    are not connected.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Github user @markalston contributed a fix for the PID controllers to prevent divide by zero errors from crashing the control process. 
                 </li>
             </ul>
