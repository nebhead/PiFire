# WLED Suggested Presets Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a "Suggested Presets" feature to PiFire's WLED integration that provides predefined LED lighting behaviors matching grill states and events, eliminating the need for manual preset configuration.

## Files Modified

### 1. `common/common.py`
**Changes**: Updated default WLED settings structure
- Added `use_suggested_presets` boolean flag
- Added `suggested_config` section with user-configurable options:
  - `cooking_color`: Choice between blue/green for cooking state
  - `idle_brightness`: Percentage for idle state brightness (1-100%)
  - `night_mode`: Boolean for dim amber night mode
  - `led_count`: Number of LEDs on the strip (1-1000)

### 2. `notify/wled_handler.py`
**Changes**: Enhanced WLED handler with direct color/effect control
- Added color mappings (`WLED_COLORS`) for RGB values
- Added effect mappings (`WLED_EFFECTS`) for WLED effect numbers
- Added `send_direct_command()` method for direct API control
- Added `send_suggested_preset()` method implementing all preset behaviors
- Updated `notify()` method to support both traditional and suggested preset modes
- Added support for additional notification events:
  - `Probe_Temp_Limit_Alarm`
  - `Grill_Warning` 
  - `Recipe_Step_Message`

### 3. `blueprints/settings/routes.py`
**Changes**: Added configuration handling for suggested presets
- Added processing for `wled_use_suggested_presets` checkbox
- Added handling for suggested configuration options:
  - `wled_cooking_color`
  - `wled_idle_brightness` (with validation 1-100%)
  - `wled_led_count` (with validation 1-1000)
  - `wled_night_mode`
- Maintained backward compatibility with traditional presets

### 4. `blueprints/settings/templates/settings/index.html`
**Changes**: Added UI controls for suggested presets configuration
- Added "Suggested Presets (Recommended)" section with info styling
- Added toggle switch to enable/disable suggested presets
- Added configuration inputs for:
  - Cooking color dropdown (blue/green)
  - Idle brightness number input (1-100%)
  - LED count number input (1-1000)
  - Night mode toggle switch
- Added conditional display logic to show/hide traditional vs suggested preset sections
- Added JavaScript function `toggleWLEDPresetType()` for UI toggling

## New Files Created

### 1. `test_wled_suggested_presets.py`
**Purpose**: Validation script for testing the implementation
- Tests color and effect mappings
- Tests all suggested preset states
- Tests grill mode transitions
- Tests notification event handling
- Tests night mode functionality
- Validates HTTP API calls without requiring hardware

### 2. `docs/WLED_Suggested_Presets.md`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for the new feature
- Complete feature overview and behavior mapping table
- Configuration instructions and setup guide
- Implementation details and technical information
- Troubleshooting guide and compatibility notes
- Advanced usage scenarios and future enhancement ideas

## LED Behavior Implementation

### State Mappings
| PiFire Mode | Suggested State | LED Behavior |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Stop | idle | Dim white solid glow |
| Startup/Prime | booting | Slow white pulse |
| Reignite | preheat | Orange slow pulse |
| Smoke/Hold | cooking | Solid blue/green (user choice) |
| Shutdown | cooldown | Orange fade effect |

### Event Mappings
| PiFire Event | Suggested State | LED Behavior |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Probe_Temp_Achieved | target_reached | Green flash (3x) |
| Probe_Temp_Limit_Alarm | probe_alarm | Red/white strobe |
| Timer_Expired | timer_done | Rainbow chase |
| Pellet_Level_Low | low_pellets | Yellow pulse |
| Grill_Warning | low_pellets | Yellow pulse |
| Recipe_Step_Message | target_reached | Green flash |
| Grill_Error_* | error | Solid red |
| Control_Process_Stopped | error | Solid red |

### Night Mode
When enabled, night mode provides:
- Very dim amber glow for idle state (30% of normal idle brightness)
- Reduced brightness for cooking state (50% of normal idle brightness) 
- Maintains color coding but reduces overall light output

## Key Features

### Smart Behavior
- **Mode Change Detection**: Only sends updates when grill mode actually changes
- **Priority System**: Alarms > Warnings > General Status > Idle
- **Cooldown Management**: Prevents notification spam with configurable duration
- **Fallback Support**: Can switch between suggested and traditional preset modes

### User Experience
- **One-Click Setup**: Enable suggested presets with single toggle
- **Minimal Configuration**: Only requires cooking color and brightness preferences
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of grill states through color coding
- **Night-Friendly**: Optional dim amber mode for minimal distraction

### Technical Implementation
- **Direct API Control**: Uses WLED JSON API for immediate color/effect changes
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of network/device issues
- **Backward Compatibility**: Traditional preset mode remains fully functional
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new states and behaviors

## Testing Results
The implementation passed all validation tests:
- ✅ Color and effect mappings loaded correctly
- ✅ All 11 suggested preset states function properly
- ✅ All 7 grill mode transitions work correctly
- ✅ All 10 notification events handled appropriately
- ✅ Night mode functionality operates as expected
- ✅ HTTP API calls generated with correct payloads

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Simplified Setup**: Users no longer need to manually configure WLED presets
2. **Optimal Visual Feedback**: Carefully designed color scheme provides intuitive status indication
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear visual cues for different cooking stages and events
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable while maintaining simplicity
5. **Future-Proof Design**: Extensible architecture for additional features
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing installations continue to work unchanged

This implementation successfully adds sophisticated LED notification capabilities to PiFire while maintaining ease of use and system reliability.
