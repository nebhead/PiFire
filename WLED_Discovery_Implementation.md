# WLED Device Discovery Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive WLED device discovery functionality to PiFire using mDNS/Bonjour and HTTP/JSON queries. Users can now click "Find WLED Devices" to automatically discover and configure WLED devices on their network.

## Components Added

### 1. Core Discovery Module (`notify/wled_discovery.py`)
- **WLEDDeviceInfo**: Class to store device information (name, IP, LED count, version, etc.)
- **WLEDDiscovery**: Main discovery class with mDNS and HTTP capabilities
- **discover_wled_devices()**: Convenience function for API integration

**Features:**
- mDNS/Bonjour service discovery for `_http._tcp.local.` services
- HTTP/JSON queries to validate WLED devices and get LED counts
- Error handling and cleanup for robust operation
- Automatic LED count detection from WLED JSON API

### 2. API Endpoint (`blueprints/api/routes.py`)
- **GET /api/wled_discover**: New endpoint for device discovery
- **Query Parameters**: `timeout` (5-30 seconds, default 10)
- **Response Format**: JSON with result, message, and devices array

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "message": "Found 8 WLED devices",
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "PiFire-WLED",
      "ip": "192.168.30.139",
      "port": 80,
      "led_count": 8,
      "version": "0.14.0",
      "product": "WLED",
      "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
      "online": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. User Interface Enhancements

#### HTML Template Changes (`blueprints/settings/templates/settings/index.html`)
- Added "Find WLED Devices" button next to device address field
- Added discovery results card with device table
- Auto-population of device address and LED count when device selected

#### JavaScript Functions
- **discoverWLEDDevices()**: Calls API and shows loading state
- **displayDiscoveredDevices()**: Renders device table with device info
- **selectWLEDDevice()**: Populates form fields when device selected
- **Error/Success messaging**: User-friendly feedback system

### 4. UI Features
- **Device Table**: Shows name, IP, LED count, version, and online status
- **Auto-Selection**: Click "Select" to automatically fill device address and LED count
- **Loading States**: Spinner and disabled button during discovery
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for network issues
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-styled components that match PiFire UI

## Installation Requirements
- **zeroconf package**: Installed via `./bin/pip install zeroconf`
- **Dependencies**: `ifaddr>=0.1.7` (auto-installed with zeroconf)

## Usage Workflow
1. User navigates to Settings → Notifications → WLED
2. Clicks "Find WLED Devices" button
3. System discovers devices via mDNS (10-second scan)
4. Results displayed in table with device details
5. User clicks "Select" for desired device
6. Device address and LED count auto-populated
7. User can save settings normally

## Discovery Process
1. **mDNS Scan**: Searches for `_http._tcp.local.` services
2. **Device Filtering**: Identifies potential WLED devices by name patterns
3. **HTTP Validation**: Queries `/json/info` and `/json/state` endpoints
4. **LED Count Detection**: Extracts LED count from segment data
5. **Results Assembly**: Returns validated devices with full information

## Error Handling
- **Network Issues**: Graceful timeout and error messaging
- **No Devices Found**: Helpful troubleshooting tips displayed
- **API Failures**: Fallback error responses with user guidance
- **Cleanup Errors**: Suppressed zeroconf cleanup exceptions

## Testing
- **Functional Test**: Successfully discovered 8+ WLED devices
- **API Test**: `/api/wled_discover` endpoint working correctly
- **UI Test**: Device selection and form population working
- **Error Cases**: Network timeouts and no-device scenarios handled

## Integration Notes
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing WLED functionality unchanged
- **Optional Feature**: Discovery fails gracefully if zeroconf unavailable
- **Performance**: Discovery runs asynchronously, doesn't block UI
- **Memory Efficient**: Devices cleaned up after discovery

## Discovered Device Example
During testing, successfully discovered:
- PiFire-WLED (192.168.30.139) - 8 LEDs
- MonitorLight (192.168.30.184) - 73 LEDs  
- wled-leftnook (192.168.30.194) - 71 LEDs
- RocketLight (192.168.30.156) - 13 LEDs
- And 5 more devices...

## Future Enhancements
- Network range scanning for non-mDNS devices
- Device capability detection (effects, segments)
- Saved device profiles
- Bulk device management
- Device health monitoring

The implementation provides a professional, user-friendly way to discover and configure WLED devices, significantly improving the setup experience for PiFire users.
